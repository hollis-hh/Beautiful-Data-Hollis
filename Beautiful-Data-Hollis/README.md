Title: Counting Jabs Until I Return ‘Home’

This project demonstrates mapping vaccination rates and death toll data from a covid database to movements on a pen plotter, the AxiDraw using the [p5.axidraw library](https://github.com/jmpinit/p5.axidraw).

Context:

Throughout the pandemic, I had to travel between Hong Kong and United Kingdom while completing my studies. There was a constant worry of not being able to return home due to the number of death cases that appear on the news amid the pandemic. Despite the increased number of vaccinations in both countries, the death toll seems to be never-ending. This personal experience became a source of motivation for the data I have chosen to explore. Through the examination of two datasets on COVID-19, I aim to depict a lack of 'safeness' in both countries despite the increased number of vaccinations being administered. In return, I hope to reflect my experiences of grief and lost in both countries that I consider to be 'home.'


Objective: 

This project explores how data visualization can be used to uncover and illustrate disparities in how people in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom perceive safety and uncertainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The project involves comparing the two locations based on statistical data, with a particular focus on vaccination and mortality rates, to visually depict the challenges faced during the pandemic. Through this analysis, the project aims to elicit a collective response by capturing public sentiment and attitudes towards the enduring challenge of mortality, even as vaccination efforts persist. How does the visualization of vaccination and mortality rates influence our perception and way of navigating through uncertainty? How do acts of political misinformation such as the anti-vaccination movement impact the deliberate sowing of confusion, uncertainty and chaos? The main goal of this project is to elicit an emotive response of ‘fear’ through data visualisation. By bringing statistical information perceptible to the human eye – through repetitive movements symbolizing the recurring cycle of death and vaccine administration - the project delves into a profound exploration of the persistent fear and uncertainty consistently present yet concealed beneath the surface of news coverage.



Aim:
- Visual representation of two different sets of data (1. total vaccinations 2. total deaths)
- Pen up and pen down motion = total no. of vaccinations
- Pen move front and back = total no. of deaths
- Despite the ongoing adminstration of vaccinations, death cases in both HK and UK are still apparent
- The aim is to use a syringe or a needle to represent the administration of vaccinations
